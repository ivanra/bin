# random-utils

A few scripts that usually find their way to my `$HOME/bin`.

## Installing

Copy the scripts to a local folder (preferrably one in `$PATH`), and make sure they're set as executable.
Alternatively, you can install the scripts straight from the repository to, for example, $HOME/bin, like so:

		curl -s -L https://github.com/ivanra/random-utils/tarball/master |
		tar xvzf - --strip-components 1 --exclude=".gitignore" \
		--exclude="README*md" --exclude="LICENSE" -C "$HOME/bin"
